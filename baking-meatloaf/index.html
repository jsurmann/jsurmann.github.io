        <h1>Baking Meatloaf</h1>
            <div></div>
    </header><p>A while back, I had the loose idea to only eat meat products where I was involved in the production as much as possible within my capabilities. As a first step, I bought the necessary cuts from our local, self-slaughtering butcher. Making my own salami didn&rsquo;t work in a first attempt (the mold took over), so I wanted to try something easier. On youtube I found a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAdQl0RyILY">good tutorial on how to make meatloaf</a>.</p>
<p>Cutting up and mincing the pork shoulder, back fat, and pork cheek was an unusual experience. Chicken breast is quite a different thing.</p>
<p>The meatloaf was fantastic, perhaps because the fat percentage was very high. I gave a few slices away to family, and froze the rest. The meatloaf also made a great bread topping.</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;m currently trying to eat vegan, there is no more meatloaf for now. But I can highly recommend to give this a try.</p>
