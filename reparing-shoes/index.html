        <h1>Reparing Shoes</h1>

<p>When I started working after graduation, my girlfriend told me that it was time to buy some decent shoes for everyday wear. Until then, I wore random trainers or low shoes, which did their job until they fell apart into various individual parts. Anyone who mentions the words &ldquo;shoes&rdquo; and &ldquo;duct tape&rdquo; to my mom can expect some adventurous stories from my youth.</p>
<p>In a random shoe store of a major chain, after a short search, we spotted what seemed to be the ideal pair of shoes. Reduced from 80 to 50 euros, brown leather with sneaker soles and comfortable. She liked it, so here we go.</p>
<p>After a year in which I wore the shoes regularly, but not daily, first disappointment spread. The sole of the shoes was completely worn in some areas, a plastic skeleton under the rubber came out piece by piece. This annoyed me for one reason in particular: the leather was still in good shape despite moderate care. Throwing it away was therefore out of the question initially. A local cobbler took care of the problem (&ldquo;Holy shit&rdquo;) and was finally able to glue new sneaker soles on my shoes for a total of 40 euros. With that, my shoes were initially fit again.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a few weeks after the repair, the inner lining of the shoes in the area of the heel dissolved piece by piece into the air. Simply sewing it back on at the existing seam was not possible, the inner lining would have had to be completely replaced. Although the leather was still in great condition, I gave up at that point.</p>
<p>A few months later, my little toes started drilling their way through the thin fabric of my running shoes. Throwing them away directly was out of the question, so I made two patches out of old clothes and sewed them to the shoes by hand over the holes. This really does not look great, but I still use the shoes today. Because again, all other parts of the shoes are perfectly fine.</p>

<p>Inspired by the idea to put more on sustainability and repairability in shoes, I started to research. Because also my black leather shoes, which I wear on business trips, could use a little better care and maintenance. After all, I bought them once for the senior prom. At a dealer for shoemaking supplies in Dortmund, I was able to buy a starter set for shoe repairs. At the roadside I found an old metal toolbox, which I now use as a shoe repair box after a quick rust removal.</p>

<p>With the help of the tools I completely resoled my black leather shoes. In Amsterdam I later bought some red leather shoes second hand. These also got new soles. There is hope that my current shoes last much longer compared to the past.</p>
