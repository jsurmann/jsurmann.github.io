    </header><p>Some time ago, we bought a new TV, as the old one was making a significant contribution to our electricity costs. It was also time to replace the old PA speakers I had been using in the living room by a more visually and technically elegant solution. Unfortunately, using only the speakers built into the TV was not an option, as you can clearly hear the lack of available space.</p>
<p>After some market research, visits to stores, various online forums and so forth, I decided on a simple, self-assembled soundbar.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-dont-like-about-off-the-shelf-soundbars">What I don&rsquo;t like about off-the-shelf soundbars</h2>
<p>Although I&rsquo;ve been interested in speaker construction for some time, I initially wanted to buy a soundbar in a store or order one online. I noticed:</p>
<h3 id="1-soundbars-are-very-difficult-to-compare-with-each-other">1. Soundbars are very difficult to compare with each other</h3>
<p>The prices of soundbars cover a fairly wide price range. From around 39 euros to four-figure sums, everything is included. However, the advertising campaigners manage to attach various ingenious sound technologies, special modes or virtual surround sound to all the speakers. All products impress with incomparable sound quality, pulsating bass and other outstanding features. Apparently, all soundbars are top class. However, there is no detailed measurement or description of the frequency response or other reliable characteristics such as the signal-to-noise ratio of the soundbars. The origin of the different prices therefore remains a mystery, at least to me.</p>
<h3 id="2-where-do-all-these-ratings-come-from">2. Where do all these ratings come from?</h3>
<p>There are plenty of product reviews, (paid) product tests and comparisons on the Internet. However, I am suspicious of reviews from buyers, because even the cheapest products are often described as having a superb sound. Product tests also seem to be positively biased, with the scale of sound quality often only ranging from good to extremely good. In hi-fi forums, however, the exact opposite seems to be the case: All purchasable soundbars are complete crap.</p>
<h3 id="3-i-cant-repair-a-store-bought-soundbar">3. I can&rsquo;t repair a store bought soundbar</h3>
<p>While a purchasable soundbar has all sorts of useful and less useful features, this complexity also makes it less repairable. A lot of electronics are built into a compact plastic housing with minimized manufacturing costs. Digital signal processors ensure a system sound quality that could not be achieved without algorithms. Technically, of course, it is impressive to get the maximum out of the built-in components, but this makes the speaker more complicated than necessary.
In addition, the sound is often transmitted wirelessly if there are separate speaker cabinets. If the subwoofer doesn&rsquo;t connect properly to the system at some point, I&rsquo;m completely out of luck.</p>
<p>Even with a (passive) self-built loudspeaker cabinet as described below, there is of course no alternative but to use an amplifier. However, due to the low power required, many used audio amplifiers, amplifiers from disused stereo systems and small amplifier kits from the Internet can be used. So I can get away cheaply and am flexible in terms of functionality.</p>
<h2 id="building-a-miniacl-soundbar">Building a MiniACL soundbar</h2>
<p>I need a construction plan so that I can assemble a soundbar myself. A randomly assembled speaker with any dimensions and shape will not sound good in the vast majority of cases. When developing new speaker geometries, simulations and numerous calculations are necessary. Since I don&rsquo;t see myself in a position to do this, I ordered a <a href="https://lautsprecherselberbauen.de/Bausatz-Mini-ACL-Passiv">kit from Udo Wohlgemuth</a>. This gives me access to a fully developed and tested design. The speaker kit consists of speaker chassis, insulating wool, electrical components for the crossovers, cables, connection terminals, screws and bass reflex tubes. The only thing missing is the wood. I opted for inexpensive coarse chipboard, which not only has good acoustic properties, but is also very cheap.</p>
<p>With the help of the supplied construction plan, I cut all the wooden parts to size using a hand-held circular saw.</p>
<p><img src="/img/speaker0.jpg" alt="Speaker"></p>
<p>I marked out the openings for the speaker chassis, connection terminals and bass reflex tubes with an old pair of circular compasses and cut them out with a jigsaw.</p>
<p>I then assembled the speaker housing step by step and glued it together with the help of wood glue. By the way, expensive wood glue that doesn&rsquo;t require clamps or weights is another advertising lie, or I was too stupid.</p>
<p><img src="/img/speaker1.jpg" alt="Speaker"></p>
<p>Several chambers with identical air volumes divide the inside of the speaker enclosure. This principle of the so-called Acoustic Chamber Line was developed by Udo Wohlgemuth.</p>
<p><img src="/img/speaker2.jpg" alt="Speaker"></p>
<p>After drying, the components can be installed in the speaker housing. You don&rsquo;t need to be a professional with a soldering iron to connect the few components. A hot glue gun is used to fix the components in place.</p>

<p>After installing the electrical components and some insulating wool, the speaker is ready.</p>

<p>The quality increase when watching TV or listening to music compared to the internal speakers of our TV is enormous. To quantify the difference in quality, I borrowed a lab microphone and a recording device from work. I measured the frequency response of the new soundbar, the TV and the laptop. However, I realized that I would first have to become familiar with the topic in order to make a proper comparison. Maybe one day&hellip;</p>
