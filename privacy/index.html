<p>Personal data (usually referred to just as &ldquo;data&rdquo; below) will only be processed by us to the extent necessary and for the purpose of providing a functional and user-friendly website, including its contents, and the services offered there.</p>
<p>Per Art. 4 No. 1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, i.e. the General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;GDPR&rdquo;), &ldquo;processing&rdquo; refers to any operation or set of operations such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation, alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination, or otherwise making available, alignment, or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction performed on personal data, whether by automated means or not.</p>
<p>The following privacy policy is intended to inform you in particular about the type, scope, purpose, duration, and legal basis for the processing of such data either under our own control or in conjunction with others. We also inform you below about the third-party components we use to optimize our website and improve the user experience which may result in said third parties also processing data they collect and control.</p>
<p>Our privacy policy is structured as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Information about us as controllers of your data</li>
<li>The rights of users and data subjects</li>
<li>Information about the data processing</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="1-information-about-us-as-controllers-of-your-data">1. Information about us as controllers of your data</h3>
<p>The party responsible for this website (the &ldquo;controller&rdquo;) for purposes of data protection law is:</p>

<h3 id="2-the-rights-of-users-and-data-subjects">2. The rights of users and data subjects</h3>
<p>With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail below, users and data subjects have the right</p>
<ul>
<li>to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being processed, information about the data being processed, further information about the nature of the data processing, and copies of the data (cf. also Art. 15 GDPR);</li>
<li>to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16 GDPR);</li>
<li>to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17 DSGVO), or, alternatively, if further processing is necessary as stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing per Art. 18 GDPR;</li>
<li>to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by them and to have the same transmitted to other providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR);</li>
<li>to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe that data concerning them is being processed by the controller in breach of data protection provisions (see also Art. 77 GDPR).</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom it discloses data of any such corrections, deletions, or restrictions placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR. However, this obligation does not apply if such notification is impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. Nevertheless, users have a right to information about these recipients.</p>
<p><strong>Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the right to object to the controller&rsquo;s future processing of their data pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an objection to data processing for the purpose of direct advertising is permissible.</strong></p>
<h3 id="3-information-about-the-data-processing">3. Information about the data processing</h3>
<p>Your data processed when using our website will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose for its storage ceases to apply, provided the deletion of the same is not in breach of any statutory storage obligations or unless otherwise stipulated below.</p>
<h4 id="server-data">Server data</h4>
<p>For technical reasons, the following data sent by your internet browser to us or to our server provider will be collected, especially to ensure a secure and stable website: These server log files record the type and version of your browser, operating system, the website from which you came (referrer URL), the webpages on our site visited, the date and time of your visit, as well as the IP address from which you visited our site.</p>
<p>The data thus collected will be temporarily stored, but not in association with any other of your data.</p>
<p>The basis for this storage is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the improvement, stability, functionality, and security of our website.</p>
<p>The data will be deleted as soon as the purpose of the processing no longer applies.</p>
<p>We use the following hoster for the provision of our website:</p>

<p>If you contact us via email or the contact form, the data you provide will be used for the purpose of processing your request. We must have this data in order to process and answer your inquiry; otherwise we will not be able to answer it in full or at all.</p>
<p>The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR.</p>
<p>Your data will be deleted once we have fully answered your inquiry and there is no further legal obligation to store your data, such as if an order or contract resulted therefrom.</p>
<h4 id="youtube">YouTube</h4>

<p>We would like to point out that this might cause user data to be processed outside the European Union, particularly in the United States. This may increase risks for users that, for example, may make subsequent access to the user data more difficult. We also do not have access to this user data. Access is only available to YouTube.</p>

<h4 id="general-linking-to-third-party-profiles">General linking to third-party profiles</h4>
<p>The provider includes a link on the website to the social media listed below.</p>
<p>The legal basis for this is Article 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The legitimate interest of the provider is to improve the quality of use of the website.</p>
<p>The user is only forwarded to the service of the respective social media by clicking on the link.</p>
<p>After the customer has been forwarded, information about the user is recorded by the respective social media. This is initially data such as IP address, date, time and page visited. If the user is logged into his/her user account of the respective social media at the same time, the social media operator can, if required, assign the information collected from the user’s specific visit to the user’s personal account. If the user interacts via a “Share” button of the respective social media, this information can be stored in the user’s personal user account and, if required, be published. If the user wants to prevent the collected information from being directly assigned to his/her user account, the user must log out before clicking on the graphic. It is also possible to configure the respective user account accordingly.</p>
