    </header><p>My mother-in-law gave me an old sewing machine that she no longer needed. I was thrilled. An Elna Lotus ZZ from Switzerland, about 50 years old. The housing is made of metal. At home, however, it ended up in the closet for a while. Until now.</p>
<p>After many attempts, I was able to thread the machine correctly and sew a first seam. The adventure begins.</p>
<h4 id="level-1">Level 1</h4>
<p>Do you know those colorful foam dishcloths you can buy in the supermarket? After a while they crumble all over the place and you have to buy new ones. So what could be more obvious than sewing rags for cleaning, washing up and personal hygiene? The material was old towels and shirts that had been sorted out.</p>

<p>New boxer shorts were needed. With the help of a <a href="https://magazin.snaply.de/boxershorts-naehen/">free pattern</a> I have now sewn together six copies. For the first I needed five hours, for the last two and a half. This means that the financial value per hour of work is higher than that of brewing beer!</p>

<p>For years, my lightweight 40 liter backpack has been my travel companion. Because it is slim cut and has an opening only at the top, however, you always have to unpack a bunch of stuff, even to reach small items. Since buying new is out of question, we try to solve this problem with a zipper bought on the Internet for about 3 euros.</p>
<p><img src="/img/bag1.jpg" alt="Sewing"></p>
<p>After carefully marking the center line, I separated the front of the backpack with scissors. Now there is no turning back.</p>
<p><img src="/img/bag2.jpg" alt="Sewing"></p>
<p>To prevent the cut fabric from tearing, I first sew off the edges. With the boxer shorts this is trivial, but with the already sewn-together backpack it&rsquo;s a challenge, especially at the bottom of the future zipper. Constantly the backpack gets stuck somewhere and hinders me.</p>
<p><img src="/img/bag3.jpg" alt="Sewing"></p>
<p>Before cutting the front, the two edges of the fabric touched. Now that a zipper with its width is sewn between the edges of the fabric, the two sides are a little too wide. Therefore, I sew both sides inwards. That also looks better. Theoretically.</p>
<p><img src="/img/bag4.jpg" alt="Sewing"></p>
<p>After sewing in the zipper, I need to sew the bottom end to the backpack. I do this by hand because the fabrics are too thick at this point and I can&rsquo;t really sew with the machine at this position anyway. Well&hellip;</p>
<p><img src="/img/bag5.jpg" alt="Sewing"></p>
<p>Even if it is not visually perfect, the experiment worked and I do not have to buy another backpack after all.</p>
